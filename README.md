# A sounds library example sorted for [Live 4 Life project](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life) TO COME SOON

This sounds library comes from a huge collection of [Drum Machines](https://github.com/ritchse/tidal-drum-machines/tree/main/machines) for SuperDirt and Tidal from [Renzo Torr](https://github.com/ritchse). I am currently adapting it to sort and fit it for the sound performance tool [Live 4 Life](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life).
