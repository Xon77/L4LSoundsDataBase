# A sounds library example sorted for [Live 4 Life project](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life) to come soon!

This sounds library has been developed to work specifically with the sound performance tool [Live 4 Life](https://github.com/Xon77/Live4Life).

Currently it mainly comes from a huge collection of [Drum Machines](https://github.com/ritchse/tidal-drum-machines/tree/main/machines) for SuperDirt and Tidal from [Renzo Torr](https://github.com/ritchse). I am currently trying to adapt, sort and fit this collection for the performance tool. Other sound categories will be added in the future.

In file [`SoundsLibrary_Utility.scd`](/SoundsLibrary_Utility.scd), you find the way I've explored this collection of sound files [by category](/SoundsLibrary_Utility.scd#L107-L116) or [by machine](/SoundsLibrary_Utility.scd#L158-L163), or how to batch process the change of file names [here](/SoundsLibrary_Utility.scd#L43-L100).
